                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>For an enduring period of time the options for a decent compiler for the
                Quake C programming language were confined to a specific compiler known as QCC.
                Attempts were made to extend and improve upon the design of QCC, but many foreseen
                the consequences of building on a broken foundation.
                The solution was obvious, a new compiler; one born from the NIH realm of sarcastic wit.
                We welcome you. You won't find a better Quake C compiler.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Compiler Design</h3>
                GMQCC Imploys several modern strategies for lexing, parsing, understanding and
                generating executable bytecode.  These stratagies are unlike anything present
                in any existing QuakeC compiler.  With them GMQCC is capable of generating correct
                optimal byte code while preventing you from writing broken code.
                <p>
                </p>

                <h3>Compatability With Code</h3>
                <p>GMQCC is committed to keeping backwards compatability with your existing QuakeC code,
                to do this we support the oddities, and otherwise broken or incorrect behaviour of existing compilers
                such as QCC and FTEQCC, so that you can rest easy knowing your code will work.
                </p>
